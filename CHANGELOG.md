### Added
- Export command generates `.vswizly.js` intended for version control so teams share the same rules.
- Project configuration via `.vswizly.js` takes precedence over VS Code settings.
- Optional `autoTransformOnCreate`: automatically transform new `.html` files.
- Optional `autoTransformToast`: info notification after auto‑transform, configurable via project config.
- File watcher for new HTML files.
